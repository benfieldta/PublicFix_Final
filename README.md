# PublicFix_Final
Final public works citizen interface

This project's intent was to create a way for citizens to be able to have input into public works issues that they recognized
needed addressing within their cities. We accomplished this by creating an application that allows users to log in using
Google authentication through Firebase, find their location utilizing Google Maps' API, and report an issue that needs to be
fixed. The information is sorted through Firebase as well and could be routed to individual servers based on the area that the 
issue was logged.

The long-term goal of this project is to be able to market it to cities who are attempting to be more citizen-focused by
allowing them to have a direct interface with city departments. The program is expandable to fire/crime/incident reporting, 
as well as other areas that we likely haven't even discovered yet.
